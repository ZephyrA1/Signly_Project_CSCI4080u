# Signly
**Signly** is a mobile learning app concept designed to help young adults/adults learn sign language through short, interactive lessons, quizzes, and gamified progress.

## Problem
Many people struggle with communication barriers (accents, varying terminology across languages, etc.), and there’s limited everyday accessibility for communicating with Deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. Sign language can help bridge communication across cultures.

## What Signly Does
- **Guided learning** with multiple **modules/lessons**
- **Interactive practice** (not just memorization): matching, typing/sentence exercises, and quizzes
- **Progress + achievements** to encourage consistent learning
- **Free Mode practice** concept: camera-based practice with a sign-to-text overlay (prototype-level interaction)

## Learning Modules
1. **Alphabet**
   - Interactive hand demonstrations, motion guides, repetition exercises
   - Goal: confidently spell names/places/simple words with correct hand shapes and positioning
2. **Words**
   - Common words/phrases with guided practice, visuals, quick quizzes
   - Focus on recognition, retention, and proper movement
3. **Sentences**
   - Sentence structure + grammar rules unique to sign language
   - Practice real-life conversations with interactive dialogue scenarios

## Prototype
This project includes an interactive **Figma** prototype created from storyboard flows and tested with a moderated task-based usability evaluation.

### Core flows in the prototype
- Login/Sign Up → Module list → Lessons → Quizzes → Progress/Profile
- Free Mode → Start camera overlay → Exit safely back to app

## Usability Evaluation (high-level)
Example evaluation tasks:
- Sign in / sign up
- Access modules and navigate lessons (next/previous)
- Complete a quiz and receive feedback (correct/incorrect)
- View progress / profile
- Find Free Mode and enter/exit camera overlay safely

## UX Notes / Design Principles
- Large, consistent touch targets (especially bottom navigation)
- Clear back navigation on deep screens
- Confirmation feedback after key actions (e.g., quiz submission)
- Minimal, fun visual style intended for teens/adults

## Roadmap / Next Improvements
- Add a **personalized dashboard** landing page (progress, awards, profile)
- Make **Free Mode** easier to discover (not dependent on scrolling)
- Add **quiz results** screen (score + continue)
- Improve **accessibility** (contrast + larger text support)
